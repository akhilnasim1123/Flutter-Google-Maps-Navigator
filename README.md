## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilnasim1123/Flutter-Google-Maps-Navigator.git
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```
### 3️⃣ Configure Google API Key
In your Flutter code (main.dart), replace the placeholder key:
```bash
const String googleApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
## ⚠️ Important:
Do not commit your real Google API key to GitHub.
You can store it safely in a .env file or local build config.

### 4️⃣ Enable Google APIs

Enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud Console:

- **Maps SDK for Android**
- **Maps SDK for iOS**
- **Places API**
- **Directions API**
Then, restrict your key to your app’s package name and SHA-1 fingerprint for security.

### ▶️ Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```
### 🧭 How It Works

1. **On startup, the app requests location permission and fetches your current GPS location.**

2. **You can search for a place using the floating search button.**

3. **Once selected, the app fetches route directions between your current location and destination.**

4. **The map displays a blue polyline for the route path.**
